{/* Routing is the process of determining how an application responds to a client request, typically a web browser or mobile app, based on the requested URL and HTTP method. It's like a traffic cop that directs incoming requests to the appropriate handler or controller, which then generates a response. */}
//GET
//Purpose: Retrieve a resource,Response: The requested resource is returned in the response body
//POST
//Purpose: Create a new resource,Response: The newly created resource is returned in the response body
//PUT
//Purpose: Update an existing resource,Response: The updated resource is returned in the response body
//When a client sends a request to a server, the routing mechanism kicks in. The server analyzes the requested URL and HTTP method to determine which action to take.

//JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based data format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.
//In Express.js, middleware functions are functions that have access to the entire request object (req), the entire response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. 

//Cookies 
//are small text files stored on a user's device by a web browser. They contain data, such as user preferences, login information, or other settings, that can be accessed by a website or web application. Cookies are sent by a website to a user's browser, which then stores them and sends them back to the website on subsequent requests.
//Cookies are used because they provide a way for websites to store and retrieve data on a user's device, allowing for a more personalized and efficient user experience.
//In HTTP, headers are key-value pairs that are sent with the request or response to provide additional information about the request or response. 
//The parsed cookies are then stored in the req.cookies property, which is an object that contains the cookie data.

//In web development, a route is a way to map an incoming HTTP request to a specific handler function or controller action. 
//In other words, routes determine what happens when a user visits a specific URL or sends a request to a specific endpoint.
//There are several types of routes, including:
//GET routes: Handle GET requests, typically used for retrieving data.
//POST routes: Handle POST requests, typically used for creating new data.
//PUT routes: Handle PUT requests, typically used for updating existing data.


//TOKENS:
//a token is a string of characters that represents a set of claims or permissions. Tokens are used to authenticate and authorize users, allowing them to access protected resources or perform specific actions.
//A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The token is digitally signed and contains a payload that can be verified and trusted.
//When a server receives a JWT token, it can verify the signature by recalculating it using the same secret key and comparing it to the provided signature.
